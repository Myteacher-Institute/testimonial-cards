                        I have been solving all the project ideas on roadmap.sh and I am surprised how far I have come
                        from where I started.

                        Since starting my career in 2021, I have only followed one resource, roadmap.sh, it truly helped
                        me go from 0 to having a job and changing the financial trajectory of my family

                        I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior developers.
                        It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.

                    roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it during my university days in
                    2018. Back then, it was just a single repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much
                    impact it has had on millions of lives since then.
