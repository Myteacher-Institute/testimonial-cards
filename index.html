                        I have been solving all the project ideas on roadmap.sh and I am surprised
                        how far I have come from where I started.

                        Since starting my career in 2021, I have only followed one resource,
                        roadmap.sh. It helped me go from 0 to having a job and changing
                        the financial trajectory of my family.

                    I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior
                    developers. It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.

                    roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it
                    during my university days in 2018. Back then, it was just a single
                    repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it
                    has had on millions of lives since then.
